# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

- [X] Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
- [X] Details along with Steps to recreate:
	- The Show Salespeople in the blue target website does not sanitize the id input before using it in a SQL query. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection.
	- The GIF walkthrough below recreates this vulnerability by producing a blind SQL injection.
	- While viewing information about a saleperson if the id parameter is set to a valid id (8 or 2 for example), the page loads almost immediately.
	- SQL can be injected by setting the id paramter to a malicious SQL command/fragment. Provided below is the SQL fragment used in the GIF walkthrough below,  
	`' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'`
	- When the above sql command is injected, the database sleeps for 5 seconds while querying the data and hence we see the delay in loading the page.
	- The other two websites protect against this by sanitizing all input before using it in a SQL query.

- [X] Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
- [X] Details along with Steps to recreate:
	- The Blue target website is vulnerable to both session hijacking and session fixation attacks.
	- The GIF Walkthrough below demonstrates a session hijacking attack.
	- For the attack shown below, two different web browsers are used (Chrome browser is used as the target, and Firefox is used as the attacker)
	- Using the Chrome browser, log into the staff section and then using the provided PHP script copy the logged-in session ID of the target.
	- Next on the Firefox browser (attacker), use the provided PHP script to change it's session id to the copied session id.
	- After changing the session id in the Firefox browser, the attacker should have access to the staff area without actually loggin in.
	- As mentioned in the assignment notes, the other two websites protect against this by expiring its active sessions and requiring its users to re-login after every 30 minutes.

## Green

- [X] Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
- [X] Details along with Steps to recreate:
	- A different login error message is displayed when the username is correct and password is wrong, versus when both username and password are wrong.
	- The existing username "jmonroe99" is used as a test in the walkthrough below
	- On the login page
		- When a correct username, "jmonroe99" for example, is used, the error message "Log in was unsuccessful." is displayed in bold.
		- When an incorrect username, "jmonroe9" for example, is used, the error message "Log in was unsuccessful." is not displayed in bold.
	- Thus, we can determine if the username is correct or not by determining if the error message is displayed in bold or not.
	- The other two websites protect against this by displaying the error message in bold during both the situations (when the username is correct and when the username is not correct).
