# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

- [X] Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
- [X] Details along with Steps to recreate:
	- The Show Salespeople in the blue target website does not sanitize the id input before using it in a SQL query. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection.
	- The GIF walkthrough below recreates this vulnerability by producing a blind SQL injection.
	- While viewing information about a saleperson if the id parameter is set to a valid id (8 or 2 for example), the page loads almost immediately.
	- SQL can be injected by setting the id paramter to a malicious SQL command/fragment. Provided below is the SQL fragment used in the GIF walkthrough below,  
	`' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'`
	- When the above sql command is injected, the database sleeps for 5 seconds while querying the data and hence we see the delay in loading the page.
	- The other two websites protect against this by sanitizing all input before using it in a SQL query.
